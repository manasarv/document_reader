We envision a prosperous \\nand inclusive India, in which the fruits of development reach all regions and \\ncitizens, especially our youth, women, farmers, OBCs, Scheduled Castes and \\nScheduled Tribes.  \\n2. In the 75 th year of our Independence, the world has recognised the \\nIndian economy as a ‘bright star’. Our current year’s economic growth is \\nestimated to be at 7 per cent. It is notable that this is the highest among all \\nthe major economies. This is in spite of the massive slowdown globally \\ncaused by Covid-19 and a war. The Indian economy is therefore on the right \\ntrack, and despite a time of challenges, heading towards a bright future.  \\n3. Today as Indians stands with their head held high, and the world \\nappreciates India’s achievements and successes, we are sure that elders \\nwho had fought for India’s independence, will with joy, bless us our \\nendeavors going forward. \\nResilience amidst multiple crises \\n4.

During the Covid-19 pandemic, we ensured that no one goes to bed \\nhungry, with a scheme to supply free food grains to over 80 crore persons \\nfor 28 months. Continuing our commitment to ensure food and nutritional \\nsecurity, we are implementing, from 1st January 2023, a scheme to supply \\nfree food grain to all Antyodaya and priority households for the next one \\nyear, under PM Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY). The entire \\nexpenditure of about ` 2 lakh crore will be borne by the Central \\nGovernment. \\nG20 Presidency: Steering the global agenda through challenges \\n6. In these times of global challenges, the G20 Presidency gives us a \\nunique opportunity to strengthen India’s role in the world economic order. \\nWith the theme of ‘ Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam’ , we are steering an \\nambitious, people-centric agenda to address global challenges, and to \\nfacilitate sustainable economic development.  \\nAchievements since 2014: Leaving no one behind \\n7. The government’s efforts since 2014 have ensured for all citizens a \\nbetter quality of living and a life of dignity. The per capita income has more \\nthan doubled to ` 1.97 lakh.   \\n8. In these nine years, the Indian economy has increased in size from \\nbeing 10th to 5 th largest in the world.

I now come to my direct tax proposals. These proposals aim to \\nmaintain continuity and stability of taxation, further simplify and rationalise \\nvarious provisions to reduce the compliance burden, promote the \\nentrepreneurial spirit and provide tax relief to citizens. \\n133. It has been the constant endeavour of the Income Tax Department \\nto improve Tax Payers Services by making compliance easy and smooth. Our \\ntax payers’ portal received a maximum of 72 lakh returns in a day; \\nprocessed more than 6.5 crore returns this year; average processing period \\nreduced from 93 days in financial year 13-14 to 16 days now;  \\nand 45 per cent of the returns were processed within 24 hours. We intend \\nto further improve this, roll out a next-generation Common IT Return Form \\nfor tax payer convenience, and also plan to strengthen the grievance \\nredressal mechanism.  \\nMSMEs and Professionals  \\n134. MSMEs are growth engines of our economy.  Micro enterprises with \\nturnover up to ` 2 crore and certain professionals with turnover of up to  \\n` 50 lakh can avail the benefit of presumptive taxation. I propose to provide \\nenhanced limits of ` 3 crore and ` 75 lakh respectively, to the tax payers \\nwhose cash receipts are no more than 5 per cent. Moreover, to support \\nMSMEs in timely receipt of payments, I propose to allow deduction for \\nexpenditure incurred on payments made to them only when payment is \\nactually made.  \\nCooperation \\n135. Cooperation is a value to be cherished. In realizing our Prime \\nMinister’s goal of “Sahkar se Samriddhi ”, and his resolve to “connect the \\nspirit of cooperation with the spirit of Amrit Kaal”, in addition to the \\nmeasures proposed in Part A, I have a slew of proposals for the co-operative \\nsector.'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe Acrobat Pro 10.1.16', 'creator': 'Adobe Acrobat Pro 10.1.16', 'creationdate': '2023-02-01T05:28:04+05:30', 'moddate': '2023-02-01T08:28:21+05:30', 'title': '', 'source': 'budget_speech.pdf', 'total_pages': 58, 'page': 34, 'page_label': '35'}, page_content='31 \\n \\n \\n \\n136. First, new co-operatives that commence manufacturing activities till \\n31.3.2024 shall get the benefit of a lower tax rate of 15 per cent, as is \\npresently available to new manufacturing companies. \\n137. Secondly, I propose to provide an opportunity to sugar co-operatives \\nto claim payments made to sugarcane farmers for the period prior to \\nassessment year 2016-17 as expenditure. This is expected to provide them \\nwith a relief of almost ` 10,000 crore.  \\n138. Thirdly, I am providing a higher limit of ` 2 lakh per member for cash \\ndeposits to and loans in cash by Primary Agricultural Co-operative Societies \\n(PACS) and Primary Co-operative Agriculture and Rural Development Banks \\n(PCARDBs).  \\n139.

We \\nhave taken a number of measures for start-ups and they have borne results. \\nIndia is now the third largest ecosystem for start-ups globally, and ranks \\nsecond in innovation quality among middle-income countries. I propose to \\nextend the date of incorporation for income tax benefits to start-ups from \\n31.03.23 to 31.3.24.

For better targeting of tax concessions and exemptions, \\n I propose to cap deduction from capital gains on investment in residential \\nhouse under sections 54 and 54F to ` 10 crore. Another proposal with \\nsimilar intent is to limit income tax exemption from proceeds of insurance \\npolicies with very high value. \\nRationalisation \\n143. There are a number of proposals relating to rationalisation and \\nsimplification. Income of authorities, boards and commissions set up by \\nstatutes of the Union or State for the purpose of housing, development of \\ncities, towns and villages, and regulating, or regulating and developing an \\nactivity or matter, is proposed to be exempted from income tax.

Now, I come to what everyone is waiting for -- personal income tax. I \\nhave five major announcements to make in this regard. These primarily \\nbenefit our hard-working middle class. \\n146. The first one concerns rebate. Currently, those with income up to  \\n` 5 lakh do not pay any income tax in both old and new tax regimes. I \\npropose to increase the rebate limit to ` 7 lakh in the new tax regime. Thus, \\npersons in the new tax regime, with income up to ` 7 lakh will not have to \\npay any tax.  \\n147. The second proposal relates to middle-class individuals. \\n I had introduced, in the year 2020, the new personal income tax regime \\nwith six income slabs starting from ` 2.5 lakh. I propose to change the tax \\nstructure in this regime by reducing the number of slabs to five and \\nincreasing the tax exemption limit to ` 3 lakh. The new tax rates are: \\n` 0-3 lakh Nil \\n` 3-6 lakh 5 per cent \\n` 6-9 lakh 10 per cent \\n` 9-12 lakh 15 per cent \\n` 12-15 lakh 20 per cent \\nAbove ` 15 lakh 30 per cent \\n \\n148. This will provide major relief to all tax payers in the new regime. An \\nindividual with an annual income of ` 9 lakh will be required to pay only  \\n` 45,000/-. This is only 5 per cent of his or her income. It is a reduction of 25 \\nper cent on what he or she is required to pay now, ie, ` 60,000/-. Similarly, \\nan individual with an income of ` 15 lakh would be required to pay only  \\n` 1.5 lakh or 10 per cent of his or her income, a reduction of 20 per cent \\nfrom the existing liability of ` 1,87,500/.  \\n149.

Each salaried person with an \\nincome of ` 15.5 lakh or more will thus stand to benefit by ` 52,500. \\n150. My fourth announcement in personal income tax is regarding the \\nhighest tax rate which in our country is 42.74 per cent. This is among the \\nhighest in the world. I propose to reduce the highest surcharge rate from 37 \\nper cent to 25 per cent in the new tax regime. This would result in reduction \\nof the maximum tax rate to 39 per cent. \\n151. Lastly, the limit of ` 3 lakh for tax exemption on leave encashment \\non retirement of non-government salaried employees was last fixed in the \\nyear 2002, when the highest basic pay in the government was ` 30,000/- \\npm. In line with the increase in government salaries, I am proposing to \\nincrease this limit to ` 25 lakh. \\n152. We are also making the new income tax regime as the default tax \\nregime. However, citizens will continue to have the option to avail the \\nbenefit of the old tax regime. \\n153. Apart from these, I am also making some other changes as given in \\nthe annexure. \\n154. As a result of these proposals, revenue of about ` 38,000 crore –  \\n` 37,000 crore in direct taxes and ` 1,000 crore in indirect taxes – will be \\nforgone while revenue of about ` 3,000 crore will be additionally mobilized. \\nThus, the total revenue forgone is about ` 35,000 crore annually. \\n155.
